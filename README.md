# Cherry and Berry plant leaf disease classification using Modified AlexNet
**Plant diseases represent a significant risk to global food security and the lives of smallholder farmers, who rely heavily on agriculture and healthy crops.** Smallholder farmers in developing nations account for over 80% of agricultural production. Reports indicate that these farmers experience a crop loss of more than fifty percent as a result of pests and plant diseases. By 2050, the global population is projected to exceed 9.7 billion, hence elevating food security as a significant problem in the forthcoming years is utmost important. Scientists from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations have estimated that plant diseases alone result in an annual economic loss of approximately US $220 billion worldwide.

This paper utilizes sophisticated deep learning methods, notably utilizing the improvised **AlexNet framework**, to tackle the intricacies of diagnosing illnesses in cherries and berries. The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), such as the AlexNet model, signifies a significant change in plant pathology. This paper highlights the crucial significance of deep learning in transforming plant leaf disease detection procedures.

### Proposed AlexNet:

* *The cherry and berry leaf dataset has been trained on Proposed AlexNet, ResNet150 and YOLO.*

### Results:
Below figure shows the accuracy measure between YOLO, ResNET150 and Proposed AlexNet. The proposed network displayed the **95.78% Accuracy**, meanwhile ResNet150 and YOLO are below 90%.
