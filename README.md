Tihe agricultural landscape encounters difficulties, particularly the requirement for prompt and precise identification of plant diseases to guarantee worldwide food security. 
This article utilizes sophisticated deep learning methods, notably utilizing the improvised AlexNet framework, to tackle the intricacies of diagnosing illnesses in cherries and berries. With the global population projected to surpass 10 billion by 2050, the need for enhanced food production becomes of utmost importance. 
The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), such as the AlexNet model, signifies a significant change in plant pathology. This paper highlights the crucial significance of deep learning in transforming plant leaf disease detection procedures. The experimental configuration, carried out on a computer with precise hardware specifications, entails both quantitative and qualitative evaluations to thoroughly verify the model's functionality. The new AlexNet model is compared to known approaches such as YOLO, ResNet150 in a comparative study. The assessment criteria, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, offer a detailed comprehension of the model's effectiveness in detecting cherry and berry plant leaf diseases. The research on the AlexNet model enhances oneâ€™s understanding of itspossibilities and adds to the existing information on utilizing advanced technology for sustainable and efficient agricultural operations.
